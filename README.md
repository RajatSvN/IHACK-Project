# IHACK-Winner-Project(Software Track)

Sentinel is an application that we made using web development and machine learning to prevent the occurence of cyber bullying. In today's world with social media dominating every individual's life, cyber bullying is a major issue. Thus in order to reduce that we came up with this solution.

### Working

This app is basically running on your local server and is continously evaluating the comments that are being made on the site. If the machine learning model finds out that your comment is not fit for public display, it flags it. As simple as that :).

#Running the Web project

1. Set up the flask development environment
2. activate it and run predict.py as : python predict.py in terminal or cmd
3. Access the project on localhost:5000/static/LiveStream.html
